# Grid-searches-and-how-they-are-optimized-differently
Basically implemented a couple of grid searches in order to measure the time it took for each one, it doesn't show in the code but you can measure it independently one by one by commeting out the code and its respective function.

To run you should just need a C++ compiler wether it be G++ or Clang it should work either way.
Open in IDE and hit run
